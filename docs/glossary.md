# Glossary

This glossary is intentionally **relational**.

Every entry links to at least one other entry. The glossary forms a **single connected graph**:
no term stands alone, and no concept is primitive in isolation.

## Quantum Field
A fundamental entity defined everywhere in spacetime. Fields are the basic ingredients of modern physics; particles, forces, and interactions are all described in terms of fields.

**See also:** [Particle](#particle), [Interaction](#interaction), [Emergence](#emergence)

---

## Particle
A localised, quantised excitation of a quantum field, observed as a discrete event (for example, a detector click). “Particle” is a context-dependent description, not a fundamental object.

**See also:** [Quantum Field](#quantum-field), [Measurement](#measurement), [Wave–Particle Duality](#wave–particle-duality)

---

## Interaction
A structural coupling in the equations of motion that makes the evolution of one field depend on another. Interactions are defined mathematically, not observationally.

**See also:** [Coupling](#coupling), [Lagrangian](#lagrangian), [Force](#force)

---

## Coupling
A parameter that sets the strength of an interaction between fields. Different couplings determine how readily fields exchange energy, momentum, or other conserved quantities.

**See also:** [Interaction](#interaction), [Lagrangian](#lagrangian)

---

## Lagrangian
A mathematical object encoding the dynamics of fields. It specifies both how fields evolve in isolation and how they interact through coupling terms.

**See also:** [Interaction](#interaction), [Coupling](#coupling), [Quantum Field](#quantum-field)

---

## Force
An emergent, classical-level description summarising the effects of field interactions on localised excitations. Forces are not fundamental entities but approximations valid in the classical limit.

**See also:** [Interaction](#interaction), [Emergence](#emergence), [Classical Limit](#classical-limit)

---

## Coherence
The preservation of well-defined phase relationships within a quantum system. Coherence is required for interference and other distinctly quantum phenomena.

**See also:** [Decoherence](#decoherence), [Superposition](#superposition)

---

## Decoherence
The dispersal of phase information from a system into many uncontrolled environmental degrees of freedom. Decoherence explains the emergence of classical behaviour without invoking collapse.

**See also:** [Environment](#environment), [Coherence](#coherence), [Measurement](#measurement)

---

## Environment
All degrees of freedom not explicitly tracked as part of the system of interest. The environment plays a central role in decoherence and the emergence of classical records.

**See also:** [Decoherence](#decoherence), [Subsystem](#subsystem)

---

## Entanglement
The inseparability of quantum states across subsystems, such that the state of the whole cannot be reduced to independent states of its parts. Entanglement is a relational property, not an intrinsic one.

**See also:** [Subsystem](#subsystem), [Decoherence](#decoherence), [Superposition](#superposition)

---

## Subsystem
A partition of a larger quantum system, defined pragmatically rather than fundamentally. Subsystems are meaningful only relative to decoherence and experimental context.

**See also:** [Entanglement](#entanglement), [Environment](#environment), [Measurement](#measurement)

---

## Measurement
The physical process by which a system becomes entangled with an apparatus and subsequently decoheres, producing stable, classical records. Measurement is not a special dynamical law.

**See also:** [Decoherence](#decoherence), [Classical Record](#classical-record), [Particle](#particle)

---

## Classical Record
A stable, redundant imprint of a quantum outcome in the environment, allowing consistent agreement among observers. Classical records are the end products of measurement.

**See also:** [Measurement](#measurement), [Decoherence](#decoherence)

---

## Superposition
A linear combination of possible quantum states. Superposition enables interference and entanglement, but is fragile under decoherence.

**See also:** [Coherence](#coherence), [Entanglement](#entanglement)

---

## Classical Limit
The regime in which quantum behaviour averages out and effective classical laws emerge. The classical limit is characterised by strong decoherence and robust classical records.

**See also:** [Decoherence](#decoherence), [Force](#force), [Emergence](#emergence)

---

## Emergence
The appearance of stable, higher-level behaviour from underlying dynamics without introducing new fundamental laws. Classical objects, forces, and trajectories are emergent phenomena.

**See also:** [Classical Limit](#classical-limit), [Force](#force), [Quantum Field](#quantum-field)

---

## Gravity-Induced Collapse
A speculative class of proposals in which gravitational effects cause an objective breakdown of quantum superposition. No experimental evidence currently supports such mechanisms.

**See also:** [Superposition](#superposition), [Decoherence](#decoherence)

---

## False Vacuum
A metastable configuration of a quantum field that is not the lowest possible energy state. A false vacuum may decay via quantum tunnelling, changing the local laws of physics.

**See also:** [Quantum Tunnelling](#quantum-tunnelling), [Quantum Field](#quantum-field)

---

## Quantum Tunnelling
A probabilistic transition through an energy barrier that is forbidden in classical physics. Tunnelling plays roles in particle physics, chemistry, and cosmology.

**See also:** [False Vacuum](#false-vacuum), [Superposition](#superposition)

---

## Wave–Particle Duality
The context-dependent appearance of quantum excitations as either localised events or extended interference patterns. This duality reflects limitations of classical categories.

**See also:** [Particle](#particle), [Coherence](#coherence)

---

## Relational Ontology
The view that relations are fundamental and that objects are derived, stable patterns within a network of interactions. Quantum theory naturally supports a relational ontology.

**See also:** [Entanglement](#entanglement), [Subsystem](#subsystem), [Emergence](#emergence)
