## Quantum Field
A fundamental entity defined everywhere in spacetime. Fields are the basic ingredients of modern physics; particles, forces, and interactions are all described in terms of fields.

**See also:** [Particle](#particle), [Interaction](#interaction), [Emergence](#emergence)

---

## Particle
A localised, quantised excitation of a quantum field, observed as a discrete event (for example, a detector click). “Particle” is a context-dependent description, not a fundamental object.

## Interaction
An interaction is a physical coupling between degrees of freedom that constrains how quantum states evolve together over time. In quantum theory, interactions are not forces acting on pre-existing objects, but structural terms in the dynamical laws that link otherwise independent components of a system.

Formally, interactions appear as coupling terms in the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian of a theory. These terms prevent the total system from being decomposed into independently evolving parts, thereby enabling entanglement and information exchange. In the absence of interaction, subsystems evolve independently.

Interactions act on quantum fields, not on classical particles. What appear as particle–particle interactions in experiments are manifestations of underlying field couplings. The particle picture is an emergent, context-dependent description that becomes useful only after decoherence and localisation.

The specific form of an interaction determines which observables become correlated and which bases are stabilised by decoherence. Measurement, for example, is not defined by an abstract projection rule, but by the concrete interaction structure between a system, an apparatus, and the environment.

Interactions therefore function as **constraints** on possible joint evolution. They do not select outcomes or inject randomness; they delimit which correlations can form and persist. In this sense, interactions define the relational structure of the theory rather than acting as causal pushes or pulls.

At the classical level, interactions give rise to effective forces. These forces summarise the averaged effects of underlying quantum interactions under conditions where decoherence is strong and quantum coherence is negligible.

Interactions are thus fundamental to quantum theory: they make subsystems meaningful, enable entanglement, drive decoherence, and ground measurement without invoking observers or collapse.

## Coupling
A parameter that sets the strength of an interaction between fields. Different couplings determine how readily fields exchange energy, momentum, or other conserved quantities.

**See also:** [Interaction](#interaction), [Lagrangian](#lagrangian)

---

## Lagrangian
A mathematical object encoding the dynamics of fields. It specifies both how fields evolve in isolation and how they interact through coupling terms.

**See also:** [Interaction](#interaction), [Coupling](#coupling), [Quantum Field](#quantum-field)

---

## Force
A force is an effective, classical-level description of how the motion of localised degrees of freedom changes over time. Forces are not fundamental entities in quantum theory; they are emergent summaries of underlying interactions when systems behave approximately classically.

In classical physics, forces appear as vectors causing acceleration according to deterministic laws. In quantum theory, however, the fundamental description is given in terms of fields and interaction terms in dynamical equations, not forces acting on objects. The force concept arises only after localisation, averaging, and decoherence suppress quantum interference.

Formally, forces emerge in regimes where expectation values of quantum operators follow approximately classical trajectories. Under these conditions, the effects of interaction terms in the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as effective potentials or forces acting on classical variables.

Forces therefore depend on context. They presuppose:
- a well-defined subsystem,
- strong decoherence selecting stable classical states,
- and a scale at which quantum fluctuations are negligible.

Outside these conditions, the force description breaks down and must be replaced by the underlying interaction picture.

Different fundamental interactions give rise to different classical forces depending on symmetry, coupling strength, and scale. For example, electromagnetic interactions produce familiar forces between charges, while quantum chromodynamic interactions confine quarks and do not yield simple long-range forces.

Forces are thus bookkeeping devices: powerful, indispensable, and predictive within their domain of validity, but not ontologically basic. Treating forces as fundamental obscures the relational structure that quantum theory reveals.

## Coherence
The preservation of well-defined phase relationships within a quantum system. Coherence is required for interference and other distinctly quantum phenomena.

**See also:** [Decoherence](#decoherence), [Superposition](#superposition)

---

## Hilbert Space
Hilbert space is the abstract mathematical space in which quantum states are represented. Each physical state corresponds not to a point in ordinary space, but to a ray (an equivalence class of vectors differing by overall phase) in a complex vector space equipped with an inner product.

Hilbert space is **not physical space**. Its dimensions do not correspond to spatial directions or hidden coordinates. Instead, they correspond to independent degrees of freedom required to describe a system. Even a single particle can require an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, while many-particle systems typically inhabit spaces of extremely high dimension.

The structure of Hilbert space encodes the core features of quantum theory. Superposition corresponds to vector addition, probabilities arise from inner products, and observables are represented by operators acting on the space. Incompatible observables reflect non-commuting operators, not experimental disturbance.

For composite systems, the Hilbert space is constructed as a tensor product of subsystem spaces. This structure allows states that cannot be factorised into independent parts, giving rise to entanglement. Whether a state is entangled therefore depends on how the Hilbert space is factorised into subsystems, reinforcing the contextual nature of subsystem definitions.

Measurement is represented mathematically by projections or more general operations on Hilbert space, corresponding to the establishment of correlations between a system and an apparatus. Decoherence explains why certain subspaces become dynamically stable and why interference between them becomes unobservable.

Hilbert space should not be reified as a hidden arena in which physics “really” takes place. It is a formal structure encoding relational constraints, probabilistic structure, and dynamical possibilities. Its power lies in what it enables us to calculate and predict, not in any direct physical interpretation.

Hilbert space thus provides the formal setting for quantum theory while remaining conceptually distinct from spacetime. Confusing the two is a common source of interpretational error.

## Decoherence
Decoherence is the physical process by which phase relationships within a quantum system become delocalised into many uncontrollable degrees of freedom in the environment. As a result, interference effects between certain alternatives become practically unobservable, even though the overall quantum state continues to evolve unitarily.

Decoherence does **not** destroy superposition or entanglement at the global level. Instead, it transfers coherence from a small, controllable subsystem into correlations with a much larger environment. From the perspective of the subsystem alone, the state appears mixed rather than coherent.

Formally, decoherence arises when a system becomes entangled with environmental degrees of freedom that are not tracked. Tracing over those degrees of freedom suppresses off-diagonal terms in the reduced density matrix of the subsystem, selecting a preferred basis in which classical behaviour is stable.

The basis singled out by decoherence depends on the interaction structure between system and environment. These interactions determine which states are robust against environmental monitoring and which rapidly lose coherence. This explains why certain macroscopic variables (such as position) behave classically, while others do not.

Decoherence explains the emergence of classical records and effective irreversibility without introducing a physical collapse of the quantum state. However, it does not by itself select a single outcome; it explains why alternatives fail to interfere, not why one is realised.

Decoherence therefore marks the boundary between quantum possibility and classical appearance. It is the mechanism by which relational quantum structure gives rise to stable, classical descriptions.

## Environment
The environment is the collection of degrees of freedom that are not explicitly treated as part of the subsystem of interest but nevertheless interact with it. The distinction between “system” and “environment” is contextual, not fundamental.

Formally, defining an environment corresponds to partitioning a global Hilbert space into a subsystem of interest and the remainder. This partition is guided by practical considerations such as experimental control, interaction strength, and observational relevance, rather than by any intrinsic boundary in nature.

The environment plays a central role in decoherence. When a subsystem interacts with many environmental degrees of freedom, information about its state becomes widely dispersed and redundantly encoded. This suppresses observable interference within the subsystem and stabilises certain classical descriptions.

The environment is not merely a sink that destroys quantum information. Globally, interactions with the environment typically *increase* entanglement by distributing coherence across larger systems. What is lost is not information, but local accessibility to that information.

Which aspects of a system become classical depends on how the environment couples to it. Environmental interactions continuously “monitor” certain variables (such as position or orientation), selecting preferred states that remain robust under further interaction. This explains the emergence of stable classical records without invoking collapse.

Because subsystem–environment distinctions are contextual, what counts as the environment in one description may itself be treated as a subsystem in another. There is no absolute environment, only relative partitions within a larger relational structure.

The environment thus provides the bridge between quantum relational dynamics and classical appearance. It enables decoherence, stabilises records, and grounds the practical irreversibility of measurement, while remaining fully part of the quantum description.

## Entanglement
Entanglement is a structural feature of quantum states in which the state of a composite system cannot be decomposed into independent states of its subsystems. Formally, an entangled state is one that cannot be written as a tensor product of subsystem states in Hilbert space.

Entanglement is **not** synonymous with strong correlation. Classical systems can be strongly correlated while remaining separable. Entanglement instead reflects non-factorisability: even when all properties of each subsystem are fully specified, the joint state contains irreducible relational information.

Whether a system is entangled depends on how it is partitioned into subsystems. There is no observer-independent, intrinsic notion of “what is entangled with what” without specifying a decomposition. Entanglement is therefore a relational property, not an attribute of isolated objects.

In composite systems, the Hilbert space is constructed as a tensor product of subsystem spaces. This structure permits states in which local descriptions are incomplete, even in principle. Measurement outcomes on one subsystem can update expectations about another because both are aspects of a single global state.

Decoherence does not destroy entanglement globally. Instead, it typically *redistributes* entanglement from small, controllable subsystems into large, uncontrollable environments, rendering it locally inaccessible while increasing global correlations.

Entanglement is thus central to quantum theory not because it enables nonlocal signalling (it does not), but because it reveals that the fundamental description of nature is irreducibly relational.

## Subsystem
A subsystem is a chosen partition of a larger quantum system, defined by selecting a subset of degrees of freedom and treating the remainder as external. Subsystems are not fundamental entities; they are contextual decompositions used to make description and prediction tractable.

Formally, defining subsystems corresponds to factorising a Hilbert space into a tensor product of smaller spaces. This factorisation is not unique, and different choices of subsystem decomposition can lead to different judgements about entanglement and separability.

Subsystem boundaries are therefore not given by nature alone. They are constrained by interaction structure, experimental accessibility, and decoherence, but they are not absolute. What counts as a “system” in one context may be part of the “environment” in another.

Entanglement is always defined *relative to a chosen subsystem decomposition*. A state may be entangled with respect to one partition and separable with respect to another. There is no observer-independent fact of the matter about entanglement without specifying the subsystem structure.

Decoherence stabilises certain subsystem decompositions by suppressing interference between alternative states, effectively selecting preferred partitions that support robust classical records. This explains why familiar macroscopic subsystems appear well-defined, despite the underlying arbitrariness of decomposition.

Subsystems thus function as pragmatic units of description rather than ontological primitives. They enable locality, measurement, and classical reasoning to emerge from an underlying relational quantum structure.

## Measurement
Measurement is a physical interaction in which a quantum system becomes entangled with a measuring apparatus and subsequently decoheres, producing stable, classical records correlated with the system’s prior state. It is not a primitive process, but a compound one involving interaction, entanglement, and decoherence.

A measurement does not require consciousness, intention, or an observer in the everyday sense. It occurs whenever information about a system becomes redundantly encoded in environmental degrees of freedom such that alternative outcomes no longer interfere.

Formally, measurement corresponds to the evolution of a composite system–apparatus state into a superposition of correlated branches, each associated with a distinct outcome. Decoherence rapidly suppresses interference between these branches by entangling them with the environment, rendering the outcomes effectively classical.

Measurement outcomes correspond to projections onto particular subspaces of Hilbert space, determined by the interaction structure between system and apparatus. Which observable is measured is therefore fixed by physical coupling, not by abstract choice alone.

Decoherence explains why measurement outcomes are stable and communicable, but it does not, by itself, explain why a single outcome is experienced rather than a superposition of alternatives. Different interpretations of quantum mechanics address this residual question in different ways, without altering the underlying formalism.

Measurement thus marks the transition from quantum relational structure to classical description. It is the process by which abstract quantum correlations become concrete, persistent records within the world.

## Classical Record
A classical record is a stable, persistent, and redundantly encoded imprint of a quantum event in physical degrees of freedom that allows consistent agreement across multiple subsystems. Classical records are the end products of measurement and the basis of objective, shared classical reality.

A record is not classical merely because it is macroscopic. It is classical because interference between alternative record states is effectively suppressed by decoherence, and because information about the outcome is distributed across many environmental degrees of freedom.

Formally, a classical record arises when a subsystem becomes entangled with an apparatus and environment in such a way that distinct outcome states correlate with nearly orthogonal environmental states. This redundancy makes the record robust against local disturbances and independent of any single observer.

Classical records are characterised by **stability** (they persist over time), **redundancy** (the same information is encoded in many places), and **accessibility** (multiple subsystems can independently acquire the same information). These properties explain why records appear objective and irreversible in practice.

The emergence of classical records does not require wavefunction collapse. Globally, the quantum state continues to evolve unitarily. What changes is that alternative outcomes no longer interfere, and the correlations defining the record become effectively permanent.

Classical records ground empirical science itself. Experimental data, memories, written notes, detector clicks, and digital files are all classical records—physical structures whose reliability arises from decoherence and environmental redundancy, not from privileged observers.

Classical records therefore mark the point at which relational quantum structure becomes part of the shared classical world. They are not fundamental objects, but emergent features stabilised by interaction with the environment.

---

## Superposition
Superposition is the principle that a quantum state can be expressed as a linear combination of other possible states within Hilbert space. It reflects the linear structure of the theory, not the coexistence of multiple classical realities.

Superposition does **not** mean that a system simultaneously possesses multiple definite classical properties. Rather, it means that the quantum state encodes multiple mutually exclusive possibilities whose relative phases can influence future probabilities through interference.

Formally, if a set of states forms a basis for a Hilbert space, any allowed state can be written as a weighted sum of those basis states. The choice of basis matters: a state that is a superposition in one basis may be a definite state in another. There is no basis-independent notion of “being in superposition.”

Superposition is therefore not an absolute property of a system, but a relational one that depends on how the state is described and which observables are considered. This is why claims such as “the particle is in two places at once” are misleading without specifying the measurement context.

Entanglement extends superposition to composite systems. An entangled state is a superposition of correlated subsystem states that cannot be factorised into independent parts. In this sense, entanglement is structured superposition across subsystems.

Decoherence suppresses the observable consequences of superposition by dispersing phase information into the environment. This does not eliminate superposition globally, but renders interference between alternatives inaccessible at the level of subsystems and classical records.

Superposition is thus a statement about how quantum states combine and evolve, not about macroscopic simultaneity or paradoxical coexistence. It is a formal feature of the theory that underlies interference, entanglement, and probabilistic outcomes.
