# Glossary

## Quantum Field
A fundamental entity defined everywhere in spacetime.
Particles are excitations of fields.

## Particle
A localised excitation of a quantum field.

## Interaction
A coupling term in the equations linking field evolution.

Links: [Coupling](#coupling), [Lagrangian](#lagrangian)

## Coupling
A parameter determining interaction strength.

## Lagrangian
Encodes dynamics and interactions of fields.

## Force
An emergent classical description of field interactions.

## Coherence
Preservation of phase relationships.

## Decoherence
Dispersal of phase information into the environment.

## Entanglement
Inseparability of quantum states across subsystems.

## Measurement
Entanglement followed by decoherence yielding classical records.

## Gravity-Induced Collapse
Hypothetical mass-dependent collapse mechanism.

## Emergence
Stable higher-level behaviour arising from underlying dynamics.

## Classical Limit
Regime where quantum behaviour averages into classical laws.

## Relational Ontology
View that relations are fundamental and objects are derived.
