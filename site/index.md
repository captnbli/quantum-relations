# Quantum Relations: A Relational Treatise

This document summarises a relational view of modern quantum physics.
No concept here is fully self-contained.

Every major term links to the glossary.
Every definition links back into the conceptual web.

This is not a theory proposal.
It is a semantic map.

## 1. There Are No Classical Objects

Modern physics does not describe a world of self-contained objects.
It describes **[fields](glossary.md#quantum-field)**,
**[correlations](glossary.md#entanglement)**,
and **[constraints](glossary.md#interaction)**.

What appear as “objects” in everyday experience are stable, emergent patterns arising from deeper relational structure.

---

## 2. Fields and Excitations

A **[particle](glossary.md#particle)** is not a tiny solid thing.
It is a localised excitation of a **[quantum field](glossary.md#quantum-field)**.

“Wave” and “particle” are descriptions of behaviour in different experimental contexts, not competing ontologies.
This tension is captured by **[wave–particle duality](glossary.md#wave–particle-duality)**.

---

## 3. Interactions

An **[interaction](glossary.md#interaction)** is not a push or pull.
It is a coupling term in the equations of motion that constrains how fields evolve together.

Interactions are defined mathematically, not observationally.
They exist whether or not anything is measured.

---

## 4. Forces

A **[force](glossary.md#force)** is a classical-level summary of the effects of interactions on localised excitations.

Forces are useful, but not fundamental.
They emerge when quantum behaviour is averaged over many degrees of freedom and **[decoherence](glossary.md#decoherence)** is strong.

---

## 5. Coherence and Decoherence

**[Coherence](glossary.md#coherence)** refers to the preservation of phase relationships in a quantum system.
It is required for interference and other distinctly quantum effects.

**[Decoherence](glossary.md#decoherence)** occurs when those phase relationships are dispersed into the **[environment](glossary.md#environment)**.
Decoherence explains why classical behaviour emerges without requiring wavefunction collapse.

---

## 6. Entanglement

**[Entanglement](glossary.md#entanglement)** is the inseparability of quantum states across **[subsystems](glossary.md#subsystem)**.
The state of the whole cannot be reduced to independent states of its parts.

Entanglement is not a mysterious force or signal.
It is a statement about relational structure.

---

## 7. Measurement

A **[measurement](glossary.md#measurement)** is a physical process in which a system becomes entangled with an apparatus and then decoheres.

The outcome is a stable **[classical record](glossary.md#classical-record)** embedded redundantly in the environment.
Measurement does not introduce new dynamics beyond interaction and decoherence.

---

## 8. Gravity and Collapse

Proposals that gravity induces an objective **[collapse](glossary.md#gravity-induced-collapse)** of quantum states remain speculative.
If real, such effects would appear as mass-dependent deviations from standard quantum predictions.

To date, no experimental evidence supports gravity-induced collapse mechanisms.

---

## 9. False Vacuum and Stability

Quantum field theories allow for **[false vacuum](glossary.md#false-vacuum)** states:
metastable configurations that are not the lowest possible energy state.

Decay of a false vacuum would proceed via **[quantum tunnelling](glossary.md#quantum-tunnelling)** and propagate outward at near light speed, altering local physics.
This is a dynamical instability, not a measurement process.

---

## 10. The Semantic Boundary

Quantum theory resists simple language because its fundamentals are relational, not object-based.

Terms like **[particle](glossary.md#particle)**,
**[force](glossary.md#force)**,
and **[measurement](glossary.md#measurement)** are indispensable,
but they are context-dependent summaries, not primitive truths.

A **[relational ontology](glossary.md#relational-ontology)** accepts this and treats relations as fundamental,
with objects as emergent conveniences.
