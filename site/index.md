# Quantum Relations: A Relational Treatise

This document summarises a relational view of modern quantum physics.
No concept here is fully self-contained.

Every term links to the glossary.
Every definition links back into the web.

## 1. There Are No Classical Objects

Modern physics does not describe a world of self-contained objects.
It describes **fields**, **correlations**, and **constraints**.

See: [Quantum Field](glossary.md#quantum-field), [Emergence](glossary.md#emergence)

---

## 2. Fields and Excitations

A particle is a **localised excitation of a quantum field**.
“Wave” and “particle” are behaviours, not identities.

See: [Particle](glossary.md#particle)

---

## 3. Interactions

An **interaction** is a coupling term in the equations that makes the evolution
of one field depend on another.

This is structural, not observational.

See: [Interaction](glossary.md#interaction), [Lagrangian](glossary.md#lagrangian)

---

## 4. Forces

Forces are emergent classical summaries of field interactions
when localisation and decoherence apply.

See: [Force](glossary.md#force), [Classical Limit](glossary.md#classical-limit)

---

## 5. Coherence and Decoherence

Coherence preserves phase relationships.
Decoherence disperses them into the environment.

See: [Decoherence](glossary.md#decoherence)

---

## 6. Entanglement

Entanglement is inseparability of quantum states across subsystems.
It is relational, not intrinsic.

See: [Entanglement](glossary.md#entanglement)

---

## 7. Measurement

Measurement is entanglement plus decoherence producing stable records.

See: [Measurement](glossary.md#measurement)

---

## 8. Gravity and Collapse

Gravity-induced collapse is speculative and unconfirmed.
If real, it would appear as mass-dependent decoherence.

See: [Gravity-Induced Collapse](glossary.md#gravity-induced-collapse)

---

## 9. Semantic Boundary

Quantum theory resists simple language because its core is relational.

See: [Relational Ontology](glossary.md#relational-ontology)
