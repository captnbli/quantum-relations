# Quantum Relations

This repository hosts **Quantum Relations: A Relational Treatise with a Cross-Linked Glossary**.

It is a documentation-first project exploring coherence, entanglement, interaction, forces,
and the semantic limits of natural language in quantum theory.

This is **not** a theory proposal.
This is a semantic map intended to keep reasoning honest.
